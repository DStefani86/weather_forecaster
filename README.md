## Usage

For this project I used bootstrap, html, css, and JavaScript. I wanted to see how far I could take a function so instead of using a bunch of functions I tried to limit it to a few. These are a few code snippets to show you a few examples I'm proud of.

I first created an event listener to receive the search input.

Next I made a function to call my API to get the lattitude and longitude for each location and turn it into data.

I then fetched the specific attributes I wanted from the API and wrote an if loop to color code a specific one while returning the data.

Resulting in a card that looks like this.
